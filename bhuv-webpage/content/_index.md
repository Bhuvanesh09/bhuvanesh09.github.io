# üëãüèΩ Hi, I'm Bhuvanesh.

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at Sprinklr, specializing in optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for large-scale deployment across various domains. At Sprinklr, I've also worked on Agentic Workflows and created insights from vast amounts of data using LLMs, all while minimizing hallucinations.

I graduated from IIIT Hyderabad, where I worked on projects involving Deep Reinforcement Learning, Graph Networks, and Computer Vision. My experience includes tackling complex problems in computational chemistry using advanced machine learning techniques. For more details about my research, visit [Publications](/publications).

Outside of work, I enjoy go-karting and consider myself pretty good at it. If you're up for a challenge, let's race! Recently, I've also rekindled my love for reading and am always looking for book recommendations. Feel free to share your favorites with me.
