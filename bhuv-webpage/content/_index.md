# üëãüèΩ  Hi ! I am Bhuvanesh.

As an ML Engineer at Sprinklr, I'm exploring the exciting frontier of Large Language Models (LLMs). My current mission is to optimize these powerful tools and unlock their potential for large-scale deployment, unlocking new possibilities across diverse domains. It's a journey of constant discovery, and I'm excited to see where it leads!

Prior to this, I graduated from IIIT Hyderabad where I worked on a variety of projects in the fields of Deep Reinforcement Learning, Graph Networks and Computer Vision. This experience allowed me to apply these innovative techniques to solve complex problems in the field of computational chemistry. You can find more details about my research work at [Publications](/publications).
