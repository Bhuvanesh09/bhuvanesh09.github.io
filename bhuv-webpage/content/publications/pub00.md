### Abstract:

The discovery of new molecules and materials helps expand the horizons of novel and innovative real-life applications. In pursuit of finding molecules with desired properties, chemists have traditionally relied on experimentation and recently on combinatorial methods to generate new substances often complimented by computational methods. The sheer size of the chemical space makes it infeasible to search through all possible molecules exhaustively. This calls for fast and efficient methods to navigate the chemical space to find substances with desired properties. This class of problems is referred to as inverse design problems. There are a variety of inverse problems in chemistry encompassing various subfields like drug discovery, retrosynthesis, structure identification, etc. Recent developments in modern machine learning (ML) methods have shown great promise in tackling problems of this kind. This has …
