### Abstract:

Spectroscopy is the study of how matter interacts with electromagnetic radiation. The spectra of any molecule are highly information-rich, yet the inverse relation of spectra to the corresponding molecular structure is still an unsolved problem. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one such critical technique in the scientists’ toolkit to characterize molecules. In this work, a novel machine learning framework is proposed that attempts to solve this inverse problem by navigating the chemical space to find the correct structure given an NMR spectra. The proposed framework uses a combination of online Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and a set of graph convolution networks to build a molecule iteratively. Our method can predict the structure of the molecule ∼80% of the time in its top 3 guesses for molecules with <10 heavy atoms. We believe that the proposed framework is a significant step in solving the …
